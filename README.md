# My Personal Project

## An application that keeps track my personal book preference and reading status
- Reading is a very personal experience: online reviews and ratings provide somewhat of a guideline for choosing new books, but an application that stores my reviews and ratings on the books I've read and accordingly analyzes my book preferences will be helpful for a more satisfying reading experience. By keeping track of the books I have read/ am reading/ stopped reading/ and would like to read along with trivial details of the books, I would obtain information that makes my reading experience enjoyable in the best way possible.

*User Stories* list:
- As a user, I would like to add a book's title, author, reading status, short commentary, and # of times read
- As a user, I would like to view a list of the books I wish to read in the future.
- As a user, I would like to view a list of the books I did not enjoy reading.
- As a user, I would like to check my favourite book(s) by referring to rating and the number of times read
- As a user, I would like to check my favourite author by referring to the number of times an author shows up in my data
