# My Personal Project: A Personal Book Organizer and Progress Tracker

## An application that keeps track of my personal book preference and reading status
- Reading is a very personal experience: online reviews and ratings provide somewhat of a guideline for choosing new books to read, but an application that stores my reviews and ratings on the books I've read and accordingly analyzes my book preferences will be helpful for a more satisfying reading experience. By keeping track of the books I have read/ am reading/ quit reading/ and would like to read along with trivial details of the books, I would obtain information that makes my reading experience enjoyable in the best way possible.

*User Stories* list:
- As a user, I would like to add a book's title, author, and total page number to a progress tracker.
- As a user, I would like to add a rating, short review, and # of times read to a list of books I've finished reading.
- As a user, I would like to view a wish list of the books I would like to read.
- As a user, I would like to view a list of the books I did not enjoy reading along with the reasons for it.
