# My Personal Project

## An application that keeps track my personal book preference and reading status
- Reading is a very personal experience: online reviews and ratings somewhat provide a guideline for choosing new books, but a personalized record will be helpful for a more satisfying reading experience. By keeping track of the books I have read/ am reading/ stopped reading/ would like to read along with trivial details of the books, I would like to make my reading experience enjoyable in the best way possible.

*User Stories* list:
- As a user, I would like to add a book's title, author, reading status, short commentary, and # of times read
- As a user, I would like to output an inventory of the books I wish to read in the future.
- As a user, I would like to output an inventory of the books I did not enjoy reading.
- As a user, I would like to output my favourite book(s) by referring to rating and the number of times read
- As a user, I would like to output my favourite author by referring to the number of times an author shows up in my data
