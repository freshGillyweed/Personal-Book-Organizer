# My Personal Project: A Personal Book Organizer

## An application that keeps track of my reading status and personal book preference
- Reading is a very personal experience: online reviews and ratings provide somewhat of a guideline for choosing new books to read, but an application that stores only my reviews and ratings on the books I've read and accordingly analyzes my book preferences will be helpful for a more satisfying reading experience. By keeping track of the books I have read/ am reading/ and would like to read along with trivial details of the books, I would obtain information that makes my reading experience enjoyable in the best way possible.
